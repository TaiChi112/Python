The street was quiet, but tension crackled in the air like a live wire.
Jake lit a cigarette with shaky hands, muttering, "Fuck this night."
Lena stood near the dumpster, arms crossed, eyes cold as steel.
"You always show up when things are already burning", she said.
Jake took a long drag. "Because you're the one who lights the match, bitch".
She laughed bitterly, stepping forward. "You're still such an asshole".
The smoke curled around his face as he smirked. "Takes one to know one".
"No, Jake. I just stopped pretending you were worth the pain".
He flicked the cigarette to the ground. "You've got some nerve, cunt".
Lena didn't flinch. "You've been calling me names since day one".
"Because you stopped acting like someone who gave a damn".
"Maybe I did", she whispered, voice cracked from holding back tears.
The silence hung like fog between them, thick and suffocating.
Jake looked away, biting his tongue hard enough to taste blood.
"I trusted you", he said, barely louder than a breath.
Lena's eyes softened, but her voice remained firm. "And I trusted you".
"You walked away", he growled.
"Because you pushed me, over and over, like a fucking child".
"So I'm the villain now"?
"You've always needed one to blame. Might as well be me".
Jake turned, fists clenched in his pockets. "I didn't mean to hurt you".
"But you did. Every damn day you made me feel invisible".
"I was scared", he admitted. “Of losing you. Of being nothing".
Lena nodded slowly. “Then maybe next time, don't act like such a coward".
And with that, she walked away, leaving nothing but silence behind her.
